                        <li>(c) we are requested to do so by government or regulatory

                            or commercially viable. In any of the above cases, we will notify you by the email address
                            associated with your account or at the next time you attempt to access your account, unless

                        any transactions on the Platform.</p>

                    <p>16.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to
                        another organization. We will contact you to let you know if we plan to do this. If you do not
                        wish to continue the contract with the transferee, you may contact us to end the contract within
                        one (1) calendar month of us informing you of the proposed transfer and we will refund you any
                        payments you have made in advance for any products not provided.</p>
                    <p>16.2 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under
                        these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.</p>
                    <p>16.3 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will
                        continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or
                        relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain
                        in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p>16.4 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still
                        enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do
                        under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this
                        contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us
                        taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase
                        you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a
                        later date.</p>
